# 1.  Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-01-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As a response to the need to keep track of architectural decisions close to the code.

## Decision

All architectural decisions will be found within the "Architectural decision log". Each decision will be tracked using a individual Architectural Decision Record. Like this one. 

Each change to the software architecture in this repository must be kept in a separate record and follow this template. For more details, please see [Michael Nygard's ADL template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

## Consequences

All decisions regarding architecture will be recorded as a record in this log. Even old ones should be recorded if the relevant history and documentation still exists.
